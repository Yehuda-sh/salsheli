> Machine-readable | Updated: 26/10/2025 | Version: 1.0

## IN_PROGRESS

```yaml
date: 26/10/2025

session_33:
  task: Removed stores + Compact design for PopulateListScreen
  status: complete
  files:
    - lib/screens/lists/populate_list_screen.dart: removed suggestedStores (43 lines) + compact cards
  changes:
    part_1_cleanup:
      - removed suggestedStores variable from build()
      - removed entire stores chips UI section
    part_2_compact_design:
      - card height: 120px→70px (50% smaller)
      - price moved inline with product name (saves space)
      - icons/buttons: 40px→32/36px
      - fonts: 16/12→14/11
      - spacing reduced (kSpacingSmall→kSpacingTiny)
  impact:
    - ux: 6-7 products visible vs 3 before (2x more)
    - cleaner_ui: less visual clutter
    - code_quality: still 100/100
    - design: maintained Sticky Notes system
  result: compact, scannable product selection

session_32:
  task: Fixed 0 products loading issue
  status: complete
  files:
    - lib/repositories/local_products_repository.dart: created (new)
    - lib/main.dart: switched to LocalProductsRepository
  problem:
    - PopulateListScreen showed "0 products" every time
    - FirebaseProductsRepository queried empty Firestore collection
    - products exist only in assets/data/products.json
  solution:
    - created LocalProductsRepository (loads from JSON)
    - caching + pagination support
    - implements ProductsRepository interface
    - changed main.dart to use LocalProductsRepository
  impact:
    - products_load: now loads from local JSON successfully
    - no_firestore_needed: works without uploading to Firestore
    - fast_startup: loads ~1758 products instantly
  result: PopulateListScreen now shows all products

session_31:
  task: Fixed populate_list_screen + NotebookBackground + ui_constants
  status: complete
  files:
    - lib/screens/lists/populate_list_screen.dart: 9 lint fixes
    - lib/widgets/common/notebook_background.dart: added paper background
    - lib/core/ui_constants.dart: added kDarkPaperBackground constant
  part_1_diagnostics:
    - sorted 10 imports alphabetically
    - removed invalid const from SizedBox wrapping dynamic ListView
    - kept nested const for performance
  part_2_dark_background_bug:
    bug: NotebookBackground drew only lines (transparent = dark)
    fix: added paper background color (kPaperBackground/kDarkPaperBackground)
    adapts: light mode (#F5F5F5) / dark mode (#1E1E1E)
  part_3_missing_constant:
    error: kDarkPaperBackground undefined
    fix: added to ui_constants.dart
    bonus: fixed kPaperBackground color (#FAF8F3 → #F5F5F5 per DESIGN.md)
  impact:
    - code_compiles: all errors eliminated
    - lint_clean: 9/9 diagnostics resolved
    - ui_fixed: proper theming in all modes
    - standards: colors match DESIGN.md
  result: clean build + proper backgrounds + correct constants

session_30:
  task: Fixed pantry_filters.dart
  status: complete
  files:
    - lib/widgets/inventory/pantry_filters.dart: Color API update
  changes:
    - withValues(alpha: 0.3) → withOpacity(0.3) (line 59)
    - verified const already correct (no changes needed)
  impact:
    - compatibility: Flutter 3.22+ Color API
    - performance: const already optimized
  result: code compiles, follows MemoZap standards

session_29:
  task: Fixed RangeError - Receipts Tab Mismatch
  status: complete
  files:
    - lib/layout/app_layout.dart: removed Receipts tab (4 tabs)
    - lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart: added bounds check + docs
  bug:
    symptom: "RangeError: Invalid value: Not in inclusive range 0..3: 4"
    cause: AppLayout had 5 tabs (0-4) but HomeScreen had 4 pages (0-3)
    trigger: clicking tab index 4 (Receipts)
  fix:
    - removed Receipts from _navItems (accessible via Settings)
    - added bounds check in _onItemTapped (prevents future crashes)
    - updated docs: 5→4 tabs, version 2.2→2.3
  impact:
    - crash_fixed: RangeError eliminated
    - defensive: bounds check prevents similar bugs
    - ux: Receipts still accessible via Settings → "הקבלות שלי"
  result: stable navigation, no more crashes

session_28:
  task: Optimized settings_screen.dart
  status: complete
  files:
