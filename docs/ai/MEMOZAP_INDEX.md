üìö MEMOZAP INDEX

For AI agent internal use only ‚Äì primary entry point for all AI instructions.
Updated: 23/10/2025 | Version: 2.2 ‚Äì Synced with UI Requirements

üß≠ Purpose

This index defines which internal AI documents exist, what each one contains, and when the agent should read them.
Every session must begin with this index ‚Üí it determines reading order and scope.

üóÇÔ∏è Documents Overview

# File Focus When to Use

1 MEMOZAP_CORE_GUIDE.md General project overview, constants, file paths, and behavioral expectations. Always load first in every context.
2 MEMOZAP_UI_REQUIREMENTS.md UX/UI decisions, layout logic, and user interaction priorities based on real user feedback. Before generating or editing any UI, widget, or screen.
3 MEMOZAP_MCP_GUIDE.md MCP tools: Filesystem, Memory, Bash, GitHub, Sequential Thinking, Brave Search ‚Äì including cooperation logic. Before performing actions involving MCP tools.
4 MEMOZAP_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md Code patterns, architecture rules, provider/repository standards, and security best practices. During code review or new feature implementation.
5 MEMOZAP_TASKS_AND_SHARING.md Mixed item model (Tasks + Products) and multi-user sharing permissions. When modifying list models, Firestore structure, or permissions.
6 MEMOZAP_DESIGN_GUIDE.md Sticky Notes design system, color palette, typography, and component layout rules. When designing or adjusting visual elements.
7 MEMOZAP_PROJECT_INFO.md File hierarchy, statistics, tech stack, and dependency overview. When the AI needs structural or dependency context.
üß© Cooperation Logic Between Guides

CORE ‚Üí always first.
Sets global context: folder paths, file naming, base assumptions.

MCP ‚Üí governs actions.
Ensures tool usage (edit_file, memory ops, etc.) follows Windows path rules.

DEVELOPER ‚Üí governs code structure.
Applies provider/repository patterns and error handling standards.

UI_REQUIREMENTS + DESIGN ‚Üí govern visuals and flows.
Translate user intent into layout and behavior.

TASKS_AND_SHARING ‚Üí governs complex logic.
Apply when working on collaborative lists or unified item systems.

PROJECT_INFO ‚Üí reference only.
For context verification and high-level structure understanding.

üîÅ Update Rules

Whenever a new .md file is added to docs/ai/, update this index immediately.

File names must remain uppercase for clarity.

Version numbers mirror the latest edit date (YYYY/MM/DD).

Each AI agent (Claude, GPT, etc.) should read only what‚Äôs required per task to minimize token usage.
